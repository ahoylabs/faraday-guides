# Tethering

## What is Tethering?

Tethering allows you to utilize all the features of the Faraday desktop app from your mobile device. It uses your local computer as a server for your mobile browser.

- **Local Data**: All the data you see in your mobile browser is read directly from your home computer. None of your data is ever saved to a remote database.
- **Mobile Chats**: You can remotely spin up models on your computer's CPU/GPU, and use them to chat with any of your local Characters on the go.
- **100% Free**: Since you are still using your own hardware to run the LLMs, there are no additional costs to use Tethering.
- **Secure**: All data is encrypted and sent over a secure connection.

## Getting Started

1. Open the Faraday Desktop App (https://faraday.dev/desktop), and click the profile icon in the top left corner. Sign in to your account, or sign up if you don’t have one yet.
