# Mobile Tethering

## What is Tethering?

Tethering allows you to utilize all the features of the Faraday Desktop App from your mobile browser.

- **Data stays local** - everything you see on mobile is read directly from your home computer. None of your data is ever saved to a remote database.
- **Mobile chats** - you can remotely spin up models on your computer's CPU/GPU, and use them to chat with any of your local Characters on the go.
- **100% free** - since you are still using your own hardware to run the LLMs, there are no additional costs to use Tethering.
- **Secure** - all data is encrypted and sent over a secure connection.

Tethering is completely opt-in, not enabled by default, and can be
turned off anytime. The desktop app can always be used without an
internet connection.

## Getting Started

1. Open the Faraday Desktop App (https://faraday.dev/desktop), and click the profile icon in the top left corner. Sign in to your account, or sign up if you don’t have one yet.
