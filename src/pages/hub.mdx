# Character Hub

Faraday includes a character hub that allows you to browse, download, and upload characters for broad range of use-cases. We have diverse group of creators that have built up a library of creative, fun, and engaging characters.

### Downloading a Character

Once you find a character you like, simply click on it, which will take you to a new screen showing that character's details. From here, you can download the character by clicking the "Download" button on the top-right of your screen.

### Posting a Character

**We would love for you to share the characters you have created with the community.**

Every character in the Hub was made by someone like you, who created something they were proud of and wanted to share it. It doesn't matter how niche, boring, weird, or whatever you might think the character is; if you enjoy using it, others likely will.

Once you are ready to post your character, click on "Post to Hub", located on the chat page in the right sidebar panel (under the character image):

On the next screen, you'll see a number of new fields to fill out:

- Provide a brief description that will go on the character card, along with a longer description in Author's Comment.
- If your character is intended for adult audiences, please mark it as NSFW. This will help people filter out NSFW cards when in the hub.
- Add any tags that will make the character easier for people to find.
- Provide a recommended model. This is usually the model you used while making the character. Users don't have to download this model to use your character.

Once the details are properly filled out, and you have read the [community guidelines](https://docs.faraday.dev/guidelines) to ensure your character meets the standards, hit "Post Character" and your character will be uploaded to the hub!

### Metrics

Faraday tracks a number of metrics for characters posted to the Character Hub. This helps the creator see how their characters are performing, and allows users to see what is trending.

- **Downloads:** The number of unique downloads a character has gotten.
- **Rating:** A rating based on user feedback given in the hub or during chat.
- **Message Count:** The number of chat responses users have sent to this character. This information is anonymous; the app pings the Faraday server with the just the character ID each time a user sends a message. This only occurs for users who have signed into the character hub and are allowing analytics.
