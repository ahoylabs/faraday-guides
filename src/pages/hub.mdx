# Character Hub

Faraday has a [character hub](https://faraday.dev/hub) for users to upload, download, and browse a library of creative, fun, and engaging characters.

### Downloading a Character

Click on any character you like, which will take you to a new screen showing that character's details. From here, you can download it by clicking the "Download" button on the top-right of your screen.

### Posting a Character

**We would love for you to share your characters with the community.**

Every character on the Hub was made by someone like you. It doesn't matter how niche, boring, weird, or whatever you might think the character is; if you enjoy using it, others likely will.

Once you are ready to post your character, click on "Post to Hub", located on the chat page in the right sidebar panel (under the character image):

On the next screen, you'll see a form to fill out:

- Provide a brief description that will go on the character card, along with a longer description in Author's Comment.
- If your character is intended for adult audiences, please mark it as NSFW. This will help people filter out NSFW cards when in the hub.
- Add any tags that will make the character easier for people to find.
- Provide a recommended model. This is usually the model you used while making the character. Users don't have to download this model to use your character.

Once the details are properly filled out, and you have read the [community guidelines](https://docs.faraday.dev/guidelines) to ensure your character meets the standards, hit "Post Character" to upload your creation to the Hub!

### Metrics

Faraday tracks a number of metrics for characters posted to the community Hub. This helps creators see how their characters are performing, and allows users to see what is trending.

- **Downloads:** The number of unique downloads.
- **Rating:** An aggregate rating based on upvotes/downvotes by individual users.
- **Message Count:** The number of chat messages sent to this character. This information is anonymous -- the app pings the Faraday server with the just the character's unique ID each time any user sends a message.
