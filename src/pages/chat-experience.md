# Customizing the Chat Experience

## Formatting

To improve readability, Faraday includes formatting for the two most popular chat syntax options; quotes and asterisks. This formatting generally does not change anything in the responses; it’s only changing what you see.

Many users write in prose format, where speech is written in quotes and actions and descriptions are plain text. Other users will write with actions and descriptions in between asterisks and speech in plain text. A handful of users are writing with speech in quotes and actions in asterisks, combining the two.

To help improve clarity, Faraday formats text between asterisks in italics, and adds color highlights to text between quotes. This way it is easy to differentiate actions from speech when reading through responses.

The model is generally accepting of any of these three methods, **as long as you are consistent**. Using prose format tends to give more prose-like responses, whereas using asterisks for actions tends to be more chat-like. For what it’s worth, the models don’t tend to follow the combined format that uses quotes and asterisks as well, but they can typically be forced with some effort.

While Faraday only formats these two types of text, other syntax can be used for different needs. For instance parentheses and brackets can successfully be used for out of context information. For instance, Faraday uses brackets around the author’s note.

## Strategies to Improve Quality

- Use example dialogue in your Character prompts!
- When you first start a new chat, we recommend that you edit incoming responses so that the model "learns" how you want the Character to speak. You can find the edit button by hovering over any message (see screenshot).
