# GPU (Graphics Card) Acceleration

Faraday supports GPU acceleration out of the box, without the need for any configuration outside of the app.

While the GGUF model format used by Faraday is optimized to run effectively on CPU, the GPU is significantly better at performing the types of calculations that are required for text generation.

Faraday will attempt to optimize the number of model layers sent to the GPU based on your hardware and the model size, giving you the fastest generations possible.

### Windows

1. Open Faraday's settings page in the left sidebar.
2. Navigate to the "GPU Support" section and pick your dedicated GPU (do not use an integrated GPU).

Advanced users can try switching from automatic to manual VRAM allocation to optimize speeds.

_Exercise caution; this process demands expertise._ Please note that every system configuration uses VRAM differently, and the VRAM amount listed in Faraday is very unlikely to match that atually used (it will always be lower than actual usage.).

To optimize your VRAM usage, you will need to run Task Manager and note how much VRAM is filled after you adjust the manual VRAM setting and enter a chat. If you get within about 300MB of your GPU's VRAM amount, you will start using shared memory, which is slow and inefficient. Again, all of this is very system dependent and also depends on what else you have open on your computer.

**Faraday's Auto GPU mode should always 'just work' whereas manual may need periodic adjustments even after you get it just right.**

### Mac

Faraday automatically uses Mac Metal, Apple's hardware-accelerated graphics API, to accelerate your text generations. There is no need to configure anything.
