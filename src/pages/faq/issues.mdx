# Troubleshooting Common Issues

For any issue not listed here, please contact the app developers by opening a bug report on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ng4vmcDfqr) with your log file (found in the Help menu at the top of your screen).

_If all else fails, you can resort to a [full reinstall](https://docs.faraday.dev/faq/factory-reset) of the app. Please note that this will delete all your data, including your characters and chats._

## Try this first!

### Clear memory on your device

- Restart the Faraday app.
- Restart your computer.
- Quit all other apps that might be using a lot of memory.

If this fixes your issue, other programs on your computer were preventing Faraday from running correctly.

### Test out a brand new character with a lower context size

- Create a brand new character (the default Faraday assistant is fine).
- Change your context size to 2048 on the "Settings" page on the left sidebar.
- Try to load a new chat.

If this fixes your issue, your device cannot handle the default context size of 4096. Use a smaller model, or lower your context size permanently.

### Run the installer again

- Download the latest installer on https://faraday.dev/ and run it again (you will not lose any data).
- Try to load a new chat.

If this fixes your issue, there was a problem with your installation.

## Why is my chat failing to complete the loading process?

### You could be running GPU support incorrectly

- Go to the Settings page, set GPU acceleration to "None", and try again. If that works, it means your GPU settings are incorrect. Please ask for help on Discord.
- Switch GPU mode to "Manual" in the settings, and set it to 10%. If that works, you can increase the percentage steadily until it breaks, which means you are out of memory.
- Do NOT use an integrated GPU with Faraday.
- Try uninstalling your GPU drivers and re-installing them to the latest version. There may be a driver mismatch.

### You could be running out of memory

Try setting the maximum context to 2048 in the "Settings" tab on the left sidebar. Then, create a brand new chat. If this works, your device cannot handle the previous context size with the model you were using.

### You may be using an unsupported device or OS

For Mac, please make sure that you are using Mac OS 12 or later.

For Windows, please make sure you are using Windows 8 or later.

### You may have conflicting GPU drivers

On Windows CUDA, download the latest Nvidia Drivers: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
