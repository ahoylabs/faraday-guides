# Re-Installing Faraday

Please try the steps listed in the [Common Issues](https://docs.faraday.dev/faq/issues) section first.

If your app is still not working properly, you can re-install it. **This will delete all your data.**

### Before re-installing:

Backup your data by [exporting](https://docs.faraday.dev/faq/import-export) any chats and characters.

Alternatively, if you cannot even open the app, save the `db.sqlite` file located in the Faraday folder (the same one referenced in the steps below). You will need to reach out to a dev for help recovering this data.

### Windows:

Delete the folder: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\faraday\`

### Mac:

Delete the folder: `~/Library/Application Support/faraday/`

**Then, reinstall with the latest installer.**
