### How do I change my model download folder?

Click on the "Change Download Location" button at the top of the screen.

### How do I use model files that I already have downloaded?

We don't recommend using custom models, but if you are an advanced user, click "Show in Finder" and drag in your models there. Make sure they all end in .gguf!

### How do I delete models?

In your list of available models, click the gear icon next to the model you want to delete. You will find a "Delete" button there.
