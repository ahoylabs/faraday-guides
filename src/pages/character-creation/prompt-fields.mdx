# Character Prompt Fields

There are two modes for creating a character:

- **"Basic Mode"** is the easiest way to get started. All you need to provide is a short description of your character, and Faraday will provide a default set of model instructions and parameters
  behind the scenes.
- **"Advanced Mode"** gives you fine-grained control over every aspect of how your character behaves. Use this mode if you want to create a more complex character.

## Fields

The following fields are available when creating a character in Advanced Mode:

### Model Instructions

Most models are trained to accept instructions at the start of the context. Here you can set what type of output you want, specific instructions for the style and format of responses, and anything else you may want the model to know about how it behaves. Note that some models are better at actually following specific instructions than others, so don't be dismayed if you give it a very specific rule to follow and it doesn't; that's normal.

### Character Persona

Input all the details on the character here using one of the styles noted above (or your own special style).

### User Persona

The AI will behave more realistically if they know something about you, the user. Include appearance, history with the character, and anything else you want here. Note that the character will know anything you type here, so if you don't think that the character should know your love of fish ladders going into the chat, don't add that detail here.

### Scenario

This is where you tell the AI what you and the character are doing together, or what the situation is. You don't have to include any information here, but it can definitely help to give the AI a direction. You may find characters in the Character Hub that have more information here than in the character persona section; some character cards are more of a scenario than specific character.

### Example Dialogue

Here is a way to influence how the AI will respond; long, short, rude, affectionate, roleplay with actions between asterisks, prose with speech in quotes. Typically, 1 - 3 examples are helpful. Note that you do not want to include important plot items here, as they can blead into the chat; try to keep these somewhat generic in terms of what's happening, but do feel free to include detail on the character or scenario, as you want that to bleed over. Also note that you do not have to include user responses. They are helpful if you want the AI to respond to specific user input, but for most cases it's not completely necessary and can save tokens to keep out.

### First Message

This is the first response from the AI character. Similarly to exmample dialogue, this is an important tool to influence how the AI character will respond. The models we use are text completion models, and when you prime the character with a first message, it will be better able to complete the text in a similar style and voice. A common issue that many creators run into is that they try to set the scene using the first message, forgetting that this message is from the character. If you don't want your character to give out of character descriptions of the scene, don't start by making it do so; get creative in how the character can set the scene in their voice.
