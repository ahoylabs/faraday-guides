# Formatting Responses

To improve readability, Faraday displays special formatting for the two most popular chat syntax options: quotes and asterisks. This formatting is only cosmetic, and does not change anything in the actual response.

**Faraday formats text between asterisks in italics, and adds color highlights to text between quotes.** This makes it easy to differentiate actions from speech when reading through your chats.

### Usage in Faraday

**The model is generally accepting of either method as long as you remain consistent.**

Using prose format tends to encourage responses that are story-like, whereas using asterisks for non-verbal actions tends to be more chat-like.
