# Author's Note

The author's note is a special feature that allows you to insert additional context immediately prior to the last user response. It is a way to influence the direction of the AI response without having to edit the character's prompt.

### Use cases

Uses of author's note include:

- specifying a genre or tone for the next response
- adding context on how the character is currently feeling, where they are, or any helpful details on the current situation
- a summary of important events from the chat history

### Usage in Faraday

The text you write in the author's note can be changed at any time, allowing you to influence the next response on the fly.

### Example

`genre: horror; style: suspenseful with building dread; current location: woods behind the abandoned house. {character} and {user} both suspect each other is the killer.`

The example includes instructions on the current style and atmosphere, as well as details about what is happening right now (as opposed to an overall scenario).

### Addition to model instructions (optional)

It may help to add something along the following lines to your model instructions to make the author's note more effective:

```
When prompted with [square brackets], you will interrupt your usual roleplay routine and use your next response to fulfill whatever request is given to you within the [square brackets].
```
