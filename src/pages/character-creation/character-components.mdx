## Components of a Character
In Faraday, characters are composed of text split into several fields. Each of these fields is explained below.
		

### Character's Display Name
		

This name is shown on your home screen or in the Character Hub. This can be more descriptive of the Character as the display name is only used in the interface, not within the chat. Note that once you upload your Character to the Character Hub, this name cannot be changed.
		

### Character's Real Name
		

This is the name of the Character that will be used within the chat. Messages sent by the Character will be prefixed with "*#Character:*", where 'Character' is the name you have chosen. The word 'character' between brackets will be replaced with your Character's real name whenever it is found within the Character Settings.
		

### User Name
		

The name of the user in the chat. This field remains editable for Characters posted to the Character Hub so that each chat can be personalized. Similar to the Character Name, Faraday has a generic term of 'user' between brackets, that should be used throughout the Character description. Faraday can switch this name out with whatever a user selects as their name.
		

### Model Instructions
		

Most models are trained to accept instructions that influence how they will respond. In Faraday, instructions are found in the character settings, under *advanced*. The default instructions used in Faraday work very well, but changing them may help tailor the output to what you want.
		

The models are *text completion models*, completing a chat, roleplay, or narrative between multiple characters, and Faraday stops generation when we want to input text as the character 'user'. Instructions should describe the *overall format* of the interaction as if describing a completed product (eg. "*a text transcript of a chat*" rather than "*You are a talking bee*".).

### Character Persona
		

Describe the Character (or Characters) you are developing. The models are good at understanding descriptions, as long as it's clearly about a specific Character and don't include contradiction. There are several common formats in the Tips section.
		

### Your Persona
		

The Character will behave more realistically if they know something about you, the User. Include appearance, history with the Character, and anything else you want here. Note that the Character will 'know' anything you type here, so don't add detail that isn't shared knowledge. When your Character is uploaded to the Character Hub, this field remains user-editable, so avoid storing important information in this field.
		

### Scenario
		

Tell the AI model what activity the User and Character are engaged in. You do not *have* to include any information here, but it can help to give the Character direction. The same rule applies here as in the Character Persona: be clear about who you are referring to.

### Example Dialogue
		

Example dialogue is a way to influence how the Character will respond: long, short, rude, affectionate, roleplay with actions between asterisks, prose with speech in quotes, etc. Typically, 1 - 3 examples are helpful. You do not want to include major plot items here, as they *can* bleed into the chat. Also, note that **you do not have to include user responses**. They are helpful if you want the Character to respond to specific user input but for most cases, it is not necessary and can save tokens to leave out. A common method of developing dialogue examples is to start chatting with your character, edit responses as necessary, and place the best responses here. This will help ensure new chats start more like the best responses.
		

### First Message
		

This is the first response **from the Character** and is an important tool for influencing how they will respond, but also for introducing Users to the Character and scenario. When you prime the Character with a great first message, they will be more able to complete the text in a similar style and voice. A common issue many run into is that they try to set the scene using the first message, forgetting that this text is *from the Character*. If you do not want your Character to give out-of-character descriptions of the scene, do not include them in your first message. Instead, get creative in how the Character can set the scene in their unique voice.

### World Info (Lorebooks)
		

Here you can input a keyword (or keywords) and an associated prompt. During the chat, the Character does not see the world info entry unless the keyword is present in the **last four messages**. Use World Info to add information you do not necessarily want to constantly use up tokens but feel is important for the Character to know. World info can also be used to trigger events in a role-playing context. Reference the World Info section for additional information.

## Prompt Components
The model you chat with is a static file that does not change or gain information. Instead, what changes is what we send to the model with each of our responses. This information is composed of four general components: the character information defined above, followed by chat history, the author's note and world info, and then your current response. Faraday sends this information to the model in this order, ending in your response.
		

## Rolling Context Window
		

All of the information sent to the model must fit within the model context. The model does not see information outside this context window. Faraday will always include the instructions, the character info, and your response, and then fill the rest of the available context with chat history. When this information exceeds the context window, Faraday begins removing the oldest chat history from the information sent to the model. If you find the model forgetting something you talked about an hour ago, this is why. This limited context window is a reason to be concise with character info so more chat history can remain in context.

Most current models are trained with a context of 4096 tokens (a token is approximately three characters) but can vary from this. Faraday offers several max model context lengths in the app settings, ranging from 2048 to 8192. The default is 2048, which is most likely to work on everyone's hardware. It is recommended that you try increasing your max context to 4096, but be aware that this may cause instability if your computer lacks the memory required for the larger context. Character Descriptions are limited to half of your current max model context setting. This is to allow space for the chat history and currently generated text to fit within the window.
