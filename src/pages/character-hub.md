# Character Hub

  Faraday includes a character hub that allows you to find, download and upload characters from a broad range of uses. We have a wonderful and diverse group of creators that have built up - and continue building - a library of creative, fun, and engaging characters.

  ## Downloading a Character
  
  Once you find a character you like, simply click on it, which will take you to a new screen showing that character's details. From here you can share a link or download the character and start chatting.

  ## Posting a Character
  
  We would love for you to share your personally made characters with the community. Every character you find in the Character Hub was made by someone like you who made a character they were proud of and wanted to share. It doesn't matter how niche, boring, weird, or whatever you might think the character is; if you enjoy using it, others likely will.

Once you are ready to post your character, follow these steps:

- In a chat with the character, click on *Post to Hub*, located in the right side chat panel under the character image.

- In the screen this brings up, you'll see a number of new fields to fill out. Provide a brief description that will go on the character card, along with a longer description in *Author's Comment*. If your character is of a sexual or gory nature, please mark it as NSFW. This will help people filter out NSFW cards when in the hub. Then add tags that will make the character easier for people to find. Lastly, provide a recommended model. This usually is just the model you used while making the character. Users don't *have to* use this model, but it can be helpful to know how to get the best responses.

- Once the details are properly filled out, and you have read the *community guidelines* to ensure your character meets the standards for the Character Hub, hit "Post Character" and your character will be uploaded to the hub.

## Metrics

Faraday tracks a number of metrics for characters posted to the Character Hub that make it easier for the creator to see how their characters are performing and for users to see what is popular or most engaging.
- Downloads: The number of unique downloads a character has gotten.
- Rating: A rating based on user feedback given in the hub or during chat.
- Chat messages: The number of chat responses users have sent to this character. This information is anonymous; the app pings the Faraday server with the just the character ID each time a user sends a message. This only occurs for users who have signed into the character hub and are allowing analytics.
