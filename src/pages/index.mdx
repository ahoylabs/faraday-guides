# Quick Start

**Faraday.dev** is a chat application that enables rich, meaningful interactions with personalized AI characters.

The app is powered by text-generation models that **run directly on your device's hardware**. This local processing keeps data in your hands and prevents outside censorship on your conversations.

You can use Faraday for roleplay, story-writing, productivity, or just casual chatting. Browse our community [Character Hub](https://faraday.dev/hub) to find an AI that suits your needs.

### Desktop Client

Faraday is available as a desktop application for MacOS Silicon, MacOS Intel, and Windows. You can download the client at [https://faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev).
