You can use Faraday for roleplay, story-writing, productivity, and more. Browse our community [Character Hub](https://faraday.dev/hub) to see how others are using Faraday.

<FAQBox title="Can I use X with Nextra?">
  The answer is “yes” for most things. Since Nextra is just a Next.js plugin, almost all the things
  that can be done with React can be done with Nextra. Here are some examples and guides:

- [Use Tailwind CSS](/docs/guide/tailwind-css)
- [Use custom CSS and Sass](/docs/guide/custom-css)
- [Use custom fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I add a live coding component in Nextra?">
  There are libraries like [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io) and
  [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) that can help you
  add live coding components to your MDX.
