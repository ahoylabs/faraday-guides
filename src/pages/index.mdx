# What is Faraday?

**Faraday.dev** is a chat application for engaging in rich, immersive conversations with AI-powered characters. You can build your own bespoke character, or select from our community-driven [character marketplace](https://faraday.dev/hub) for a diverse range of role-playing experiences.

Faradayâ€™s chat engine is powered by large language models (LLMs) that run **directly on your personal device's hardware**. This local processing ensures complete privacy and prevents any form of 3rd party interference. No one can revoke access to your data, filter your conversations, or change the behavior of your characters.

### Desktop Client

Faraday is available as a desktop application for MacOS Apple Silicon, MacOS Intel, and Windows. You can download the client at [https://faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev).
