# Quick Start

**Faraday.dev** is a chat application for engaging in rich, immersive conversations with AI-powered characters. You can build your own bespoke character, or select one from our community-driven [character marketplace](https://faraday.dev/hub) for a diverse range of role-playing experiences.

Faradayâ€™s chat engine is powered by large language models (LLMs) that run **directly on your personal device's hardware**. This local processing ensures complete privacy and prevents any form of 3rd party interference. No one can revoke access to your data, filter your conversations, or change the behavior of your characters.

## Get the app

### Desktop

Faraday is available as a desktop application for MacOS Apple Silicon, MacOS Intel, and Windows. You can download the client at [https://faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev).

## Create your first chat

### Select a model

Faraday recommends the following models to start:

- **Kunoichi 7B:** Good for lower-end devices, and excels at a wide range of tasks. This model is a great starting point for most users.
- **Mythomax-Kimiko 13B:** A larger model that is great for more complex role-play conversations. This model is recommended for users with more powerful devices.

Note that both of these models, and most others available on Faraday, are unfiltered. Please use your discretion when evaluating text generated by these models.

### Pick a character

For your first experience, we recommend downloading a Character from the [Character Hub](https://docs.faraday.dev/hub). You can access the Hub from within the app, or in [the browser](https://faraday.dev/hub).

### Start chatting

After downloading your Character, you should be taken to a screen like this:
