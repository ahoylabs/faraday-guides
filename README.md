## Running Locally

### Install

```sh
yarn
```

**Note**: You may notice that `yarn.lock` is not tracked by Git. This is due to this repo living inside a private monorepo and synced with [Copybara](https://github.com/ahoylabs/copybara-action). We use explicit versioning on all dependencies to make contributing easier for external parties.

### Run

```
yarn start
```

## Contributing
